recipeYield: 24 egg halves (12 eggs)

ingredients: 
- 12 hard boiled eggs
- ½ cup mayonnaise 
- 2 tsp white vinegar
- 2 tsp yellow mustard
- dash of black pepper
- paprika for garnish

directions:
- Remove the shells of the eggs, rinse, then cut each egg long ways in half.
- Scoop out the the yolk and put in small bowl. 
- Add all above ingredients except for paprika and begin mixing well. For best results, use a hand mixer on a high speed to whip the mixture so it is light and fluffy.
- The filling can be spooned into the yolk indentation, or for a prettier presentation, you can spoon the filling into a frosting bag with a star tip or something similar to give texture and use that to fill the center of the eggs. 
- Finish by sprinkling paprika lightly over the finished eggs. (Try one egg before adding more, in case you don’t like paprika or if it is really strong.)
- Let set in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour.

- To add a little extra something, you can use hot hungarian paprika, chili powder, or cayenne to give your eggs a different flare.

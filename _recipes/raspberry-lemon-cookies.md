recipeYield: 12 cookies

ingredients: 
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- ½ tsp vanilla
- 1 large egg
- ½ lemon, zest and juice
- ¼ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp baking powder
- ⅛ tsp baking soda
- 1½ cup flour
- ¾ cup frozen raspberries, coarsely chopped 

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350F and line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicon baking mats. Set aside.
- In large bowl or mixer, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add vanilla, egg, zest, and juice and mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. 
- Add salt, powder, soda, and flour and mix until combined. 
- Add in raspberries and mix gently by hand to incorporate them briefly. (If you mix too well, you won’t get the picturesque marbling of red running through the rest of the cookie.)
- Scoop out about a tablespoon of batter onto the prepared cookie sheet. Mixture will be extremely sticky. 
- Bake for 14-16 minutes or until they are just starting to brown on the edges and are no longer shiny at all.
- Put the rest of the batter in the fridge while the first batch is baking--as the raspberries thaw, they will add even more moisture to the batter and make it really sticky or runny. 
- Allow the cookies to cool for at least 10 minutes before eating.

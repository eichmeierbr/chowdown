recipeYield: 8 servings

ingredients: 
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 lb hamburger or spicy italian sausage
- ½ or 1 onion, diced
- 1 small container mushrooms, minced (optional)
- 1 Tbsp italian seasoning
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp basil
- ½ tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
- ~8 cup marinara sauce
- prepared lasagna noodles
- 4 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 1 cup parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 or 2 cup spinach, chopped (optional)

directions:
- Coat skillet in olive oil then add garlic. Saute over medium heat until fragrant. 
- Add hamburger or sausage, onion, and mushrooms. Season with italian seasoning, oregano, red pepper flakes, and basil and cook until browned (double seasonings if using plain hamburger). Drain any excess grease.
- Add marinara--if using store bought sauce, add a bay leaf and allow meat sauce to simmer for ~30 minutes to 1 hour on low heat to enhance flavor.
- Coat the bottom of a 9x13 pan with a thin layer of the meat sauce and then our pattern will start- lasagna noodles, meat sauce, spinach (if desired), mozzarella, sprinkle parmesan, then repeat. Usually this will continue for 3-5 layers. (Most of my dishes can only manage 3 layers)
- The final layer will be noodles, sauce, and then enough mozzarella to cover the top of the lasagna.
- Cover lasagna with aluminum foil. If the foil is touching the cheese, lightly spray the foil with nonstick spray and that will keep your cheese from sticking to the foil once it’s melted.
- Bake covered at 350F for 45 minutes. At the end of the 45 minutes, remove the foil and then bake for an additional 15 minutes. 
- Allow to cool/set for at least 15 minutes before eating (otherwise the lasagna will be VERY liquid-like. If you let it cool, it will hold together in one piece).

The spinach and mushroom really blends in with the rest of the lasagna so it’s a great way to sneak in a little bit of healthy veggies. Most people assume the spinach is basil leaves. 
As with the spaghetti, sausage will give you a better flavor overall.

tags: noodles, chicken, asian, 

recipeYield: an army (small exaggeration)

ingredients: 
- 3 cup celery, sliced
- 2-3 large chicken breasts
- 3 cup carrots, sliced
- 1 head cabbage, bite sized pieces
- 1 onion, diced
- 4 Tbsp oil
- 5 Tbsp garlic, minced
- 5-6 Tbsp chicken bouillon 
- ½ tsp ground pepper
- ⅓ cup low sodium soy sauce
- 6 cup chicken broth
- 4 packages of rice noodles

directions:
- Saute garlic in the oil until brown and fragrant. Then add chicken (cut into bite sized pieces). 
- While chicken is cooking, add bouillon and pepper. 
- Once chicken is cooked, or mostly cooked, add all other veggies.
- Add soy sauce and chicken broth to pot until veggies reach desired tenderness.
- Remove veggies and chicken from broth and set off to the side. 
- If the broth has gone down a lot, you may need to add a cup or two more of broth. Taste the mixture and make sure it is strong. If it’s a little salty, that’s okay because you’re going to add the noodles at this point and they are going to dilute and soak up all of that flavor. 
- Finally, we’re going to reincorporate the veggies and chicken with the rehydrated noodles.

- I would DEFINITELY recommend you reduce the ingredients in this recipe if you are only making this food for a family of 5-7, you could half this recipe. Otherwise, the above measurements will give you three 9x13 pans of food.

recipeYield: 24 servings

ingredients: 
- 3 egg whites
- 6 Tbsp castor sugar
- 1 cup finely ground almonds (almond flour)
- 1½ tsp additional almond flour
- 1⅓ cup confectioners’ sugar

directions:
- Preheat oven to 320F and line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicon mat.
- Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, about 5 minutes; whisk the superfine sugar into the egg whites until thick, glossy, and the mixture holds stiff peaks, 5-8 more minutes. Place a sieve over the bowl containing egg whites and sieve both amounts of almond flour and confectioners’ sugar into the the egg white mixture. (Almond flour will be more coarse than regular flour). Gently fold the almond meal and sugar into the egg whites, retaining as much air as possible. Do not over mix!
- Separate the meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if desired. Spoon the meringue into a piping bag with a ⅜ inch tip. Pipe 1 inch disks onto the prepared sheets, leaving ~2 inches between cookies.
- Let the cookies stand at room temp for ~15 minutes to form a thick skin on top. Pick up the baking sheet and let drop from several inches above the work surface to adhere cookies to baking sheet and remove air bubbles.
- Bake in preheated oven until tops are dry, ~15 minutes; let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off of the parchment paper.

recipeYield: 4 sandwiches

ingredients: 
- 8 slices of rye bread
- butter
- 1 lb thin sliced corned beef
- 12 oz. sauerkraut, well-drained
- Russian dressing
- 4 slices Swiss cheese

directions:
- There are two ways you can prepare this sandwich so be aware that these are two sets of instructions.
- To bake in the oven, spread the butter thinly on one side of the bread for 4 of the slices and on the opposite side, spread Russian dressing. Place butter side down on a baking sheet and place beef, sauerkraut, and cheese on the russian side of the bread. Top with remaining slice of bread and bake at 400F until golden brown.
- To cook on the stove top, spread butter on one side of each of the slices of bread and then build the sandwich the same as above (beef, sauerkraut, cheese, and dressing) but make sure the top slice of bread has the butter side facing outward or up. Cook on medium heat until bread is golden brown, then flip sandwich carefully and cook on other side. 
- I would recommend having a bit of the Russian dressing handy when you go to eat the sandwich since you might want the added flavor/moisture.

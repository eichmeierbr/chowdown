recipeYield: 8-10 (if multi tiered)

ingredients: 
- 1 stick of soft butter
- 1 egg
- ½ cup of cocoa powder
- pinch of salt
- ⅛ to ¼ cup of milk
- powdered sugar

directions:
- mix butter, egg, and cocoa powder in mixing bowl
- add milk and 1 cup of powdered sugar
- keep adding powdered sugar until frosting reaches desired consistency

To make Rasp. Choc. Cake, bake any favorite chocolate cake mix and cut into ~3 layers once cooled. Frost each layer, then arrange halved raspberries on top of frosting between the middle layers. Save the best raspberries for the top and arrange them “standing” upright across the entire cake. You’ll need either 2 large boxes or 4 regular sized boxes of raspberries to do this recipe.

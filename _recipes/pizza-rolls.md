recipeYield: 12 rolls

ingredients: 
- Grandma Betty’s Sweet Roll Dough
- ~1-2 cup marinara sauce
- 2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
- desired pizza toppings (bell peppers, onion, italian sausage, ham, pineapple, etc.)

directions:
- On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle that’s about ¼ of an inch thick. (The length and width of your rectangle depends on how much dough you’ve prepared)
- Spread the sauce across the dough, even up to the edges, EXCEPT on one of the long edges you should leave 3-4 inches bare without any sauce or toppings (this will be explained in a little bit).
- Sprinkle cheese and toppings evenly across the sections covered in sauce.
- Starting on the long edge with toppings, begin rolling the dough towards the opposite long edge. Try to keep the spiral nice and tight. You’ll notice as you roll that some of the filling will start creeping across that portion we left bare earlier--this is why we don’t put anything there. 
- Keep rolling until all of the dough is wrapped up in the spiral and it almost resembles a burrito. 
- Use a serrated knife to width-wise cut the dough in 2 inch wide pieces all the way down the roll.
- Gently pick up the rolls and lay them flat on a greased cookie sheet or other prepared pan for baking. You should be able to see the spiral when you lay them flat. 
- Allow the rolls to rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size then bake in an oven at 350F for ~20 minutes. Use a fork to gently touch or prod the middle of one of the rolls close to the middle of the pan to check the texture. If the roll is still doughy but the outside is getting brown, reduce heat to 325 or even 300 (if they’re really getting dark) and continue baking, setting a timer for 5 minutes and then checking to decide if additional time is needed. If the color on the rolls is fine, don’t worry about reducing temperature.
- If all else fails and the centers still won’t cook, you can put them in the microwave for 1-2 minutes before you eat them and that will cook the middle. 
- Remember to refrigerate.

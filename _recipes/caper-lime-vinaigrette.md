recipeYield: 

ingredients: 
- 2 limes, juiced
- 2 Tbsp capers
- 2 Tbsp parsley
- 1 clove garlic
- salt & pepper to taste
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1-2 Tbsp green onion, chopped

directions:
- Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl. 
- When I was at the ranch, I remember this sauce being similar in consistency to the orange vinaigrette, so an alternate way to try this recipe could be to finely blend the lime juice, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil together until they form a uniform/homogenous sauce. Then hand mix in the capers after you’re done with the blender. (I don’t know for sure that this will result in a better sauce, this is just me speculating.)

recipeYield: 12 servings

ingredients: 
- None

directions:
- If you have a piping tool with a long nozzle, then you can pipe the pastry cream right into the pastry. If you don’t have the right tools or you don’t feel confident in your piping skills, you can cut the eclairs lengthwise and then just fill them that way.
- If you chose to pipe the first way (above) then pick up the whole eclair and dip the top into the ganache. If you cut the eclairs in half, dip the top side of the top half in the ganache before placing it on top of the pastry cream. 
- Place eclairs in the fridge for at least an hour to allow them to set. 

components:
- Pate a Choux
- Pastry Cream
- Chocolate Ganache

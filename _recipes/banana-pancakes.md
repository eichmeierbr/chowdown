recipeYield: 12 pancakes

ingredients: 
- 2 cup flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp salt
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- ¼ tsp nutmeg
- ⅔ cup milk
- 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
- 3 large bananas, mashed or blended
- 2 Tbsp butter, melted

- ½ cup maple syrup
- ¾ cup powdered sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

directions:
- Mix dry ingredients in large bowl.
- Add wet ingredients to the mixture and stir until it becomes a thick, batter like consistency. (To avoid banana chunks in the pancakes, I like to blend the bananas rather than mash.)
- Cook pancakes on medium heat--because the batter is thicker, you might have to spread the batter across the skillet or griddle to get the classic, circular shape. 
- Serve with Vanilla Maple glaze.

- Please note that these pancakes are VERY filling and most people can only manage to eat 2 or maybe 3 medium sized pancakes. I recommend you start off with one and then see how you feel after that.

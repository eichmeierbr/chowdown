- This sauce can be used as a salad dressing (just add more oil), though I was introduced to it through Granite Ranch (the private vacation ranch in Jackson Hole, WY of the Rockefeller family), where they served it with King Salmon. I love to have a little orange segment and sauce with each bite of salmon which is why I listed 5 oranges as a possibility. 
- Sides that go well with this dish are wild rice and broccoli or broccolini.

recipeYield: 

ingredients: 
- 1 yellow pepper, sliced
- 1 red pepper, sliced
- ½ onion, sliced
- 1-2 Tbsp olive oil
- salt & pepper
- 1 lb chicken
- 1 packet fajita seasoning
- 1 bunch cilantro, chopped
- 2 limes, halved
- 1-2 heads romaine lettuce
- shredded mexican cheese


directions:
- In a frying pan, fry the (bite sized) sliced peppers and onion with the oil and salt & pepper until they’ve reached your desired cook. (For instance, if you like more crunch, then you probably will only get a bit of browning on them or if you like them a bit softer then you’ll let them cook more.)
- Coat the chicken in the fajita seasoning and either cook entirely in a pan or on a grill. Chop the chicken (once cool enough to handle) into bite sized pieces.
- Finely chop the cilantro and set off to the side in a small bowl or container.
- Prep the lettuce (wash and tear or chop into ~bite sized pieces)
- Put the salad together. Typically I arrange it like this- lettuce, corn salsa, peppers, chicken, cheese, cilantro, and then half a lime’s juice over the top (kind of like a dressing). Whatever you do, don’t skip the lime juice--it really enhances the whole thing.

components:
- Roasted Corn Salsa

recipeYield: 6 servings

ingredients: 
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup flour
- 3 Tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ cup milk
- 2 Tbsp butter, melted
- ½ tsp vanilla
- ¾ cup brown sugar (separate from previous)
- ¼ cup cocoa powder (separate from previous)
- 1¾ cup boiling water

directions:
- In a bowl, mix together the first five ingredients (brown sugar to salt). Do NOT combine the first brown sugar with the latter.
- In the same bowl, add the wet ingredients--milk, butter, and vanilla. Mixture should be smooth and similar to thick cake batter.
- Spread batter in the bottom of a crockpot. (Spray inside of crockpot with nonstick spray beforehand)
- In a small bowl, mix second brown sugar and cocoa powder until well mixed. Sprinkle mixture evenly over batter. DO NOT STIR. 
- Pour boiling water over the mixture and the powder and cover with lid. 
- Cook on high heat for 2-3 hours. 
- When done, the top will appear to be solid cake, but when you cut into it, there should be a chocolate pudding in the bottom. Serve cake with a scoop of ice cream and enjoy while still hot. Great leftover! This pudding cake can be reheated in the microwave and the pudding won’t lose its integrity like a molten lava cake would.

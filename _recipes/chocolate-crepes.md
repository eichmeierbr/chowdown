recipeYield: 6 servings

ingredients: 
- 1 cup flour
- 2 Tbsp cocoa
- 1 Tbsp powdered sugar
- 1Â½ cup 1% milk
- 2 large egg whites
- 1 whole egg
- 1 tsp oil

directions:
- In a blender, mix all ingredients until well combined.
- Pour some batter into the center of a frying pan and immediately begin tilting the pan in different ways to thinly spread the batter across the entire surface. 
- Cook on low to medium heat. 
- You will be able to see when the crepe is cooked through and flipping it is not necessary, but you can if you want. 
- Fill with your choice of fruit, sauces, or creams. I prefer to fill it with sliced strawberries and whipped cream and drizzle chocolate sauce over the top.

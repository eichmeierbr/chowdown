recipeYield: 6 servings

ingredients: 
- 1 lb hamburger
- 2-3 cans green beans, drained
- 2-3 cans tomato soup
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 tsp beef bouillon (optional)
- ½ tsp powdered garlic
- ½ tsp salt (optional--omit if adding bouillon)
- mashed potatoes (4-6 large potatoes worth)
- 1½ cup shredded cheddar cheese

directions:
- Brown hamburger and onion in frying pan on medium heat until cooked through. Add bouillon and garlic to enhance the flavor of the meat (omit salting the meat if adding bouillon). Stir meat well.
- Taste a little of the meat and make sure the flavor is good enough for what you want. Once it’s ready, drain any excess grease then transfer to a 9x13 pan.
- Add 2 cans of both green beans and tomato soup to the pan and mix well. If you want a more moist filling, add the third can of tomato sauce. If you want more veggies, add another can of green beans. Flatten out mixture so it’s in an even layer across the bottom of the pan.
- Spread mashed potatoes evenly across the top of the hamburger layer, then sprinkle with cheese.
- Cover with aluminum foil. (If the foil is touching the cheese, lightly spray the aluminum foil with non stick spray and that will keep the cheese from sticking) Bake at 350F for 45 minutes.
- Allow to set for 10 minutes then enjoy.

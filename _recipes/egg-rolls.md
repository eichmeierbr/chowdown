recipeYield: 

ingredients: 
- 1 pkg. Egg roll wrappers 
- ½ green cabbage, shredded finely
- ½ cup carrots, shredded finely
- 1 cup meat (chicken, pork, beef, etc.)
- ½ onion, diced
- 1 Tbsp bouillon 
- salt & pepper to taste
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce (low sodium)
- 2 eggs, beaten

directions:
- Brown meat with bouillon, onion, salt & pepper. 
- Add cabbage, carrots, and soy sauce and cook on low heat for ~10 minutes.
- Scramble (cook) eggs in another side pan then add to mixture.
- Remove mixture from heat and prepare wraps. 
- Place on wrap diagonally in front of you and spoon ~3-4 Tbsp of mixture in a thick line a little off center so it’s closer to that corner that’s closest to you. Then fold that same close corner in, towards the middle, so it goes over the filling. Then fold the two outside corners in towards the middle. At this point, it should almost resemble a 3d envelope that hasn’t been sealed yet. To finish, mix a little water and flour together in a little bowl to form a paste. Put a bit of this paste on the last remaining corner that hasn’t been folded in yet (about 1 to 1½ inches down the two sides that make up the corner) then roll up egg roll to the last corner to get that typical rounded shape. Wipe off any excess paste (or else it could burn during the frying).
- Fry egg rolls in a deep pot with ~3 inches of oil in the bottom until the egg rolls are a golden brown color. 
- Serve with sweet chili sauce. (My go-to brand is Mae Ploy)

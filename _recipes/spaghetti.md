For better flavor, I recommend using sausage. And the minced mushrooms will add some vitamins and mix really well with the texture of the meat so most people won’t notice the addition. Remember, mushrooms have a LOT of moisture, so when you brown the meat, make sure its not covered too tightly (to allow steam to escape) and that you add the mushrooms at the right step. 
If using hamburger, double the spices in the recipe and add 1 tsp salt.

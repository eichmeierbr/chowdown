recipeYield: 

ingredients: 
- 1½ lb. pork roast
- 1 packet fajita seasoning
- 1 onion, diced
- 4 cans green enchilada sauce
- 16 oz. mexican cheese
- corn or flour tortillas

directions:
- Slow cook the pork roast with the fajita seasoning for 2-3 hours on HIGH. (Pork should pull away from itself with a fork when done.)
- Make sure all bones have been removed from the pork then place the roast and its juices into a Kitchenaid and mix until pork is shredded to desired consistency.
- Spray the inside of a 9x13 baking pan with nonstick spray then spread a light layer of the enchilada sauce over the bottom. 
- Preheat oven to 350F.
- Place the following ingredients in a 1½ to 2  inch wide line down the middle of the tortilla- pork, a sprinkle of onion (~1T), ⅛ or ¼ cup sauce (drizzled across the meat), and a sprinkle of cheese. Then, roll the tortilla and place in pan with the overlapping flap face down so the weight of the tortilla holds it closed. Repeat the process until the pan is filled. 
- Smother the enchiladas in remaining sauce and sprinkle with cheese to finish. Cover with aluminum foil. (If foil is touching cheese, lightly spray the foil with nonstick spray to prevent sticking).
- Bake covered for 30 minutes, then uncover and resume baking for an additional 15. Allow 5-10 minutes to set then enjoy!

recipeYield: 4 cakes

ingredients: 
- 1 cup butter (usually unsalted but salted works just fine)
- 8 oz. bittersweet chocolate (chopped to melt easier)
- 5 large eggs
- ½ cup white sugar
- 4 tsp flour

directions:
- Preheat oven to 450 F & spray 4 oz. ramekins or custard cups with nonstick cooking spray.
- In the top half of a double boiler set over simmering water, heat the butter and chocolate, stirring occasionally until melted.
- When not stirring butter and chocolate, beat eggs and sugar together until light colored and thick in a large bowl. If using unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt to the egg mixture.
- Once both mixtures are ready, slowly drizzle chocolate mixture into egg mixture--whisking continuously as you do so. If the chocolate is not added slowly enough, then it will cook the eggs and curdle.
- Incorporate the flour into the batter.
- Divide the batter equally between 4 ramekins.
- Bake each cake for 8-10 minutes, erring on less time than more. It is possible to cook them a bit longer, but once the center is cooked through there is no saving the cake. You’ll know the cake is perfect when the outsides are cooked, but the center is dimpled (concave). 
- Let rest for 5-10 minutes.
- Loosen the cake from the mold by running a knife along the outside--between the mold and the cake. 
- Place desired plate on top of the mold and then, holding the two together, flip them so the mold is on top and the plate is now on the bottom. Gently lift mold away from cake and serve with raspberries or strawberries.

recipeYield: 6 servings

ingredients: 
- 1-2 tbsp olive oil 
- 2 lbs lean hamburger
- 1 whole onion, diced
- 1 whole bunch fresh cilantro, minced
- 1 lb pastrami, diced
- 2-3 cans minced green chiles
- ½ tsp cumin
- ½ or 1 tsp garlic salt
- ¼ tsp cayenne
- 1-2 tsp chili powder
- 2 cans tomato sauce
- ~½ cup salsa

directions:
- Add oil to bottom of pan then brown hamburger, onion, and cilantro together.
- Drain excess grease.
- Add remaining ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed. 
- Simmer over low heat for at least 2 hours for best flavor. If the mixture is too dry, add more salsa for moisture. If the mixture is too wet, keep the lid cracked while simmering to steam off excess moisture.
- Spoon lipdripper meat into tacos with your choice of toppings and enjoy.

For a healthier alternative, you can use 1 lb of ground turkey with minced mushroom in place of the hamburger. 
For a smaller dinner size, you can decrease the hamburger used to 1 lb instead of 2 and leave all of the other ingredients the same. I find that the flavor is just as good and not over powering.
To make this recipe spicier, use more cayenne and/or use “hot” salsa.

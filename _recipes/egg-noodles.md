recipeYield: 

ingredients: 
- 2½ cup flour
- pinch of salt
- 2 eggs, beaten
- ½ cup milk
- 1 Tbsp butter

directions:
- Mix flour and salt in a large bowl.
- Add beaten egg, milk, and butter, then knead until smooth. 
- Roll out dough onto a floured surface to about a ¼ or ⅛ thickness. 
- Cut into desired lengths and shapes. 
- Allow to air dry before boiling (optional--if the noodles are completely dry they take longer to cook and I haven’t noticed a negative effect on the texture if you cook them straight after cutting them out). 
- Fill a large pot with salted boiling water and cook pasta until al dente. (pull a noodle out once in a while and cut it in half to examine the texture. Or just take a bite and see if you think its done.)

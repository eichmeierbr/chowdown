recipeYield: 7 servings

ingredients: 
- ½ or 1 cup bell peppers, sliced
- ½ yellow onion, sliced radially
- ½ cup mushrooms, sliced (optional)
- 1 cup broccoli, cut into bite sized pieces
- ½ cup celery, sliced
- ½ carrot, bite sized pieces
- 1 sm. can water chestnuts, drained (optional)
- ½ or 1 lb chicken or meat, cut into bite sized pieces
- ¼ cup brown sugar, packed
- ¼ cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1 tsp sesame seed oil
- ½ tsp red pepper flakes, crushed
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- ¼ to ½ tsp corn starch
- salt & pepper
- 2-3 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 clove garlic

directions:
- Prep your veggies and chicken by cutting them up into bite sized pieces. 
- Add ~2 Tbsp oil to wok or frying pan and saute garlic until fragrant. 
- Add harder/tougher veggies like celery and carrots to the pan first--they take the longest to cook. Make sure your pan is on med. high to high heat so you can “fry” the outsides a little without getting mushy veggies. 
- After ~3 minutes, add the mushrooms. Mushrooms have a lot of moisture so only add those to the celery and carrots and let cook for 3-5 more minutes.
- Add the peppers, onion, and broccoli and cook another 3 minutes. 
- Transfer veggies to a large bowl and put pan back on heat. Add last Tbsp of oil to pan and add chicken (make sure pan is hot so you get a good sear on the outside of the chicken). Salt and pepper to taste. Once the outside of the chicken has reached your desired color, you can reduce the heat to medium and cook the rest of the way through. While you’re waiting for it to finish cooking
- In a bowl, add brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame seed oil, red pepper flakes, ginger, and corn starch together and whisk until well mixed. Add to the pan where the chicken is cooking. If the chicken is cooked, reintroduce the veggies to the pan (and add the chestnuts if desired--they provide an added crunch) and heat for a final 1-2 minutes so they can heat up a little and absorb some of the sauce. 
- If the sauce is too liquid for your taste, you can add a little more corn starch, though be careful not to add too much or you’ll end up with a bad consistency.

The amounts and composition of stir fry is not limited to what you see here. If you like some veggies but not others, that’s fine, you can omit many of the veggies here. This recipe makes a lot of food, so feel free to reduce the amounts as you see fit. I put in lots of veggies because it’s a great way to get in a rainbow of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.

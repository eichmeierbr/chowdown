recipeYield: 12 servings

ingredients: 
- ½ cup milk
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 1 cup flour
- ½ tsp vanilla
- 3 large eggs
- 2 large egg whites

directions:
- Heat milk, water, butter, and sugar over medium heat in a pot. 
- When the mixture reaches a boil, add one cup of flour all at once; stir constantly until mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball.
- Remove from heat and cool for 3 minutes. 
- Then add vanilla, eggs, and egg whites (both egg types should compositely equal one cup) and stir. 
- Put dough into a pastry piping bag and pipe the dough onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. To make mini eclairs, pipe into 2 inch lines; for regular eclairs, pipe into 4 inch lines; for cream puffs, 2 inch balls. If there are “peaks” on the pastries, wet your finger with cold water and gently smooth those down. 
- Bake at 400F for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350F and resume baking for an additional 30 minutes (could be less time depending on your oven). 
- Once the pastry is done baking and you’ve pulled it out of the oven, pierce one end of the pastry to vent the steam.

recipeYield: 12 rolls

ingredients: 
- 1 packet active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water (105-115F)
- ½ cup luke warm evaporated milk (scalded then cooled)
- ⅓ cup sugar
- ⅓ cup of butter (softened)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 egg
- 3½ to 4 cup flour (estimate--NOT a hard rule) 

directions:
- Combine yeast, warm water, and some or all of the sugar in a medium sized bowl. (The warm water activates the yeast and the sugar feeds it. If the water is too hot it will kill the yeast. If it’s too cold, the yeast won’t activate.)
- In a large bowl, mix egg, salt, and (if not all added to the yeast) sugar. 
- If you don’t want to wait a long time for the milk to cool, or if you melted the butter in the microwave because you forgotten to soften it beforehand, slowly drizzle the milk or butter into the egg mixture, stirring the egg mixture constantly. This will allow you to incorporate the new ingredients without cooking the egg and breaking the mixture. The added heat from the milk and butter can also be good for activating the yeast further when you add it.
- As long as the milk/egg mixture isn’t too hot, add yeast directly to the large bowl, making sure to scrape down the sides to get all of the sugar out of the yeast bowl. 
- One cup at a time, begin adding the flour and stirring it into the mixture. The amount of flour you end up adding in the end doesn’t matter--the consistency of the dough does. Add flour until the dough is barely not sticky enough to handle. Part way through adding the flour, you will likely have to switch from using a spoon to kneading it with your hands. For best results, focus on using the palms of your hands to knead the dough rather than your fingers. 
- Cover mixture, place it in a warm place, and let it rise until doubled in size.
- Punch down dough, shape into rolls, let them rise, then bake at 350F for 20 minutes. (Depending on your oven, the cooking time may vary and you may get better results by baking at 375F)

recipeYield: 

ingredients: 
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cobs of corn
- 1 jalapeno
- 1½ Tbsp olive oil
- 2 tomatoes, diced
- ½ red onion
- 1 bunch cilantro leaves, minced
- 1 lime, juiced

directions:
- Cut corn off of the cob. Don’t focus on cutting too deep--once the outer layer is cut off, you can run the back/blunt side of the knife down the cob and press the rest of the soft kernel innards out. If you cut too deep then you’ll risk getting part of the really tough center in your salsa.
- Cut jalapeno in half and deseed. (You’ll chop the jalapeno AFTER it’s roasted.)
- Preheat oven to 400F
- Toss corn, jalapeno, and 2 cloves of the garlic together with olive oil. Salt and pepper to taste.
- Roast for 25-30 minutes.
- Mix onion, tomato, and cilantro. Add the zest of one lime and its juice.
- Combine the two mixtures once the corn is cool.

To enhance the protein in the salsa and make it more filling, you could add black beans to the salsa.

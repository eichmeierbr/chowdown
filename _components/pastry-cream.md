recipeYield: 12 serving

ingredients: 
- 5 large egg yolks
- ¼ cup cornstarch 
- ¼ cup sugar
- pinch of salt
- 2½ cup half & half
- ¼ cup sugar
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 1 Tbsp vanilla 

directions:
- Whisk together egg yolks, cornstarch, sugar, and salt in medium bowl. 
- Heat half & half and sugar in saucepan to a simmer. 
- Slowly add cream to the egg mixture while continuously whisking so the eggs don’t cook. If you add the hot cream too quickly or don’t stir while adding it, it’s likely that the egg will cook and you’ll have to start the filling over.
- Pour the mixture back into the pan, return to heat, and whisk until large bubbles burst.
